#### A Collection of Examples, Samples, and More
## Contains:
  - ESC Driver Code for standard 1100us-1900us PWM pulse control ESC. Intended for use on 328P based platforms  
    
      
        
        
Hopefully individuals can learn more about the inner workings of code and their MCU of choice  
by reading through what is in here.  
  
  Background:
  - ESC and PWM controls require accurate timing and rapid response to control inputs  
  - Creating discrete and application specific code can result in easier use, and faster operation  
  - Internal timers are a powerful tool that can give the user far more power than abstract references
