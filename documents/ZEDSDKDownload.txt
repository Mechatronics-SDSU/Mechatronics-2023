Locate SDK Downloads


Download NVIDIA Jetson ZED SDK for L4T 35.1(Jetpack 5.0) 3.77(Jetson Xavier, Orin CUDA11.4)
NOTE: THIS IS LIKELY TO CHANGE OVER TIME (ENSURE: ORIN CUDA SUPPORT)


* Go to the folder where the installer has been downloaded.
$ cd path/to/download/folder
Can easily be found in downloads folder


* Add execution permission to the installer using the chmod +x command. Make sure to replace the installer name with the version you downloaded.
Make sure your terminal is in the folder that the ZED SDK is in
$ chmod +x ZED_SDK_JP4.3_v3.0.run
NOTE: THE VERSION YOU DOWNLOADED COULD BE DIFFERENT THAN EXAMPLE
$ chmod +x (ZED_SDK File name)


* Run the ZED SDK installer.
Ex:
$ ./ZED_SDK_JP4.3_v3.0.run
Format
$ ./(ZED SDK File name)


* At the beginning of the installation, the Software License will be displayed, hit q after reading it.
* During the installation, you might have to answer some questions on dependencies, tools and samples installation. Type y for yes and n for no.
* Say yes to all
* IT MAY ASK YOU TO REBOOT YOUR SYSTEM
* IF SO: REBOOT AND RE-EXECUTE 
$ ./(ZED SDK File name)


* NOW OPEN YOUR TERMINAL TO THE “zed” folder
* IN DEFAULT LOCATION: This will be found in 
$ /usr/local/zed
NOTE: YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE DIRECTORY OUT OF USUAL VISIBLE SCOPE
This is accomplished with “cd ..” and “ls”
Or
cd /usr/local/zed


Once in the folder: /usr/local/zed
Run python script
$ python3 get_python_api.py


LOCATE WHERE THOSE SITE-PACKAGES (cython, etc.) WENT: This should be displayed after execution of python3 get_python_api.py
Default Location of this api should be:  /home/mechatronics/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
(COULD BE DIFFERENT)
May need to use sudo to access .local folder
$ sudo cd .local


In the site-packages folder install opencv
$ pip install opencv-python


All needed packages and folders to run basic computer vision on the ORIN should now be HERE:
/home/mechatronics/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
