### **SRC Folder Description**

Within this SRC folder you will create a new folder named after your project, in the newly created project folder is where you will update code relating to the task 
you are working on.
If you are collaborating with someone who has already created a main project folder within SRC **DO NOT** create another one.
After you have created your main folder for code within this SRC folder, you will need to create a README.md file with a descrption on the project
along with a "Last Updated by: Name, Date" at the end of your README.md. In your main project folder you
can create sub folders and/or add files as you need.

### **Naming Requirements:**
 
The folder name should be easily identifiable to anyone who needs to find code related to your project. 
Name your main folder ALL lowercase, and keep the main folder name short (one word descriptor)
>(i.e. If you are working on Computer Vision name your main folder "vision")
